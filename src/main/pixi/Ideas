Feedback
 - World Color (basic expression of player mood; the goal is to improve the mood)
 - Passage of Time
 - Player breathing
 - Glow when there is something to interact with

Mechanics
 - If the player is more active, it will breath faster (less active, breath slower)
 - If the player is more active, time will pass slower (less active, time will pass quicker)
 - Color of the world starts off dark, as the player accomplishes things, the world gets brighter
 - As the world gets brighter (player mood), time will pass slower (lower mood, faster passage of time)
 - As your mood improves, more things appear on screen (or disappear)
 - Quests (trigger some series of tasks that need to be completed)
 . - Library book


TODO
 - indicate when there is something to interact with
 - put a plant in your house that you can take to the therapist


What is implemented
 - Basic foreground / background paralaxing
 - Load levels (and unload previous level)
 - pixi game loop (render loop) adpated so we can control time better (we can update zero or multiple times per render if needed)
 - actors (a basic class-like struct)
 - basic keys, mapped to player movement
 - interact with objects on screen via interact method
 - basic dialog box
 . - limit some of the dialogs to one time only
